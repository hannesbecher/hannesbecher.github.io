## What's new?
* Current Biology accepted our manuscript on patterns of genetic diversity in low-recombination regions, [unrevised preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/739888v2).
* I am spending the winter at the [Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin](https://wiko-berlin.de) as a fellow's partner.
* This year's Common Garden and Reciprocal Transplant experiments are over. Many thanks to Alex Twyford, Max Brown, Gavin Powell, and Kim Prior for making them a success! I am crunching through the data now.
