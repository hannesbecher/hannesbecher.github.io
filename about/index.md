# About Hannes

![About](../img/about.jpg)


I am a botanist turned genomicist and I have worked (and published) on Population Genomics, Epigenetics of Giant Genomes, Cytogenetics, and Historical Geobotany. I am particularly interested in how natural history (hybridisation, breeding system, population size changes, natural selection, co-evolution) affects species’ genomic diversity and, conversely, what one can tell about a species by looking at population genomic data. To explore these topics, I use high-throughput sequencing data, simulations, and experiments.

## Local adaptation in a parasitic plant
In my current postdoc in the [group of Alex Twyford](http://twyford.bio.ed.ac.uk) at the University of Edinburgh, I investigate the basis of local adaptation in *Euphrasia*, a genus of parasitic plants, many of which are polyploid. This project combines both experimental work (common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments) and bioinformatic analyses of large amounts of high-throughput sequencing data.

## Signatures of selection in genomic regions of low crossing-over
In the lab of Brian Charlesworth, I worked on the fruit fly, *Drosophila simulans*, exploring unexpected patterns of diversity in regions of low crossing-over. These regions show a low skew of the allele-frequency spectrum towards rare alleles. The pattern may be caused by associative overdominance, a genetic phenomenon where it is more beneficial to be heterozygous for two different deleterious mutations rather than to carry one deleterious mutation that is homozygous.

The results are [now published in Current Biology](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1aME23QW8RqLBN).

## Genomic differentiation across a grasshopper hybrid zone
During my PhD project with [Richard Nichols](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/richardnichols.html) at Queen Mary University of London, I worked on the hybrid zone of the grasshopper, *Podisma pedestris*, which has two chromosomally diverged groups that meet in the South of France. While there is strong selection against hybrids between these groups, there seems to be comparatively little genomic differentiation.

## Cytogenetics and epigenetics giant genomes
During a research stay in [Andrew Leitch’s](https://evolve.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/leitch/) lab at Queen Mary University of London, I worked with bisulphite sequencing data to characterise the methylation status of genomic repeats. I characterised arrays of ribosomal RNA genes and discovered a virus-related centromeric repeat in Crown Imperial Fritillaries (*Fritillaria imperialis*).

## Pollen, plant systematics, and chromosomes
I carried out undergrad and MSc studies at Martin-Luther-University in Halle (Saale). During that time, I focussed on the phylogenetics of polyploid feather grasses, on pollen analysis, and I learned how to carry out cytogenetic analyses.
