        		<h1>About Hannes</h1>
				<p>Hannes is a biologist with wide-spread interest in life-related phenomena. Being a trained botanist he has worked (and published) on Historical Geobotany, Pollen Analysis, Molecular Systematics, Cytogenetics, and Epigenetics of Giant Genomes. In Autumn 2014, he has ventured to start a PhD on Population Genetics and Sex Chromosome Evolution in grasshoppers where he applies his knowledge acquired in the plant world and is being challenged to go beyond that.
Hannes likes scripting in python and R, and he is a keen microscopist. In his spare time, he plays the clarinet in two London Bands.</p>
