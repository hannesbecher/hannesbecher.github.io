## What's going on
It looks like I have finished the lab work for my PhD!

Also, the [Genetics Society ](http://www.genetics.org.uk/) has decided to support my stay with the [Lohse Group](http://lohse.bio.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. Thanks very much!


## Later this year
* Short course on quantitative genetics at [The Roslin Institute](http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/) (Edinburgh)
