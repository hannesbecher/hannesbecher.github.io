## What's new?
* I passed my viva, yippee!
* I am currently working in the Charlesworth lab, exploring the interactions of recombination and linked selection in Drosophila.
* Looking forward to attending the [Sex Uncovered conference](http://www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/2018/Schwander_e.html) at Roscoff in April.
* Later this year I will commence a postdoc in the [lab of Alex Twyford](http://twyford.bio.ed.ac.uk) working on adaptation in *Euphrasia*. So I'll finally return to working with plants.
