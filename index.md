#Hannes Becher's web presence

##What's going on...
* At [PopGroup49](http://www.populationgeneticsgroup.org/) in Edinburgh. Have a look at my [poster](misc/Becher_ESEB_public.png)! The print version can be found in Holyrood, No 45. By the way, although missing on the ballot paper, I am elegible for the student poster price...
* Still crunching transcriptomes to find race-specific polymorphisms.
* Expecting PacBio sequencing data to come in which will help me studying mitochondrial and bacterial inserts in my grasshoppers' genomes.
