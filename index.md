## What's going on
* Still crunching transcriptomes to find race-specific polymorphisms in my grasshoppers.
* Grasshopper PacBio data have arrived! Highly uneven coverage after mapping to michtochondrial genome makes me curious what is going on with regard to NUMTs. Also, are there inter-race differences?
* Comparing these data to previously generated NextSeq reads and makin silly-looking graphs...
