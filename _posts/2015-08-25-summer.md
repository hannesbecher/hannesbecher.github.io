After a great field season, I am back to London now! Not only did I enjoy Southern French cuisine, nature, and lanscapes; but I have brought back hundreds of tubes filled with testes, legs, and frozen grasshopper brains. So there is plenty material to work on in the years to come.

Later on, I went for the first time to a massive international conference. The meeting of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology was held in Lausanne (Switzerland). Running one week with about 1500 attendees, 350 talks, more than 1000 posters, and up to eight parallel sessions, it was amazingly well organised (impeccable venue, a time table app, timing worth admiring, great food, and a conference bar with affordable beer).

My humble contribution, a poster, can be downloaded [here](../../../../../misc/Becher_ESEB_public.png). It shows that the spread of a neo-sex chromosome system in a grasshopper can easily be counteracted by directional gene flow (which is likely to occur near hybrid zones).
