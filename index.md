##What's going on
* I've enjoyed [PopGroup49](http://www.populationgeneticsgroup.org/) very much. Thanks to the organisers, supporters, and attendees for a great time and inspiring discussions!
* Still crunching transcriptomes to find race-specific polymorphisms in my grasshoppers.
* Grasshopper PacBio data have arrived! Highly uneven coverage after mapping to michtochondrial genome makes me curious what is going on with regard to NUMTs. Also, are there inter-race differences?


##Looking forward to
* [GfbS-Meeting in Munich](http://www.en.palaeontologie.geowissenschaften.uni-muenchen.de/gfbs2016/index.html) February 21stâ€“24th
